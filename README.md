# LibraryManagement  
This Library Management System is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage books efficiently using menu-driven operations. The program supports adding new books, viewing available books, issuing books to users, and returning issued books with proper status tracking. It uses arrays to store book details and ensures validation to prevent invalid inputs or duplicate issuing. The system provides a simple and interactive interface for smooth library inventory management.
